# sound-to-text â€” voice input with Whisper.cpp
sound-to-text â€” a local Windows application for speech recognition and text input simulation. It works on the basis of [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp), uses hotkeys to activate recording, displays the status in the system tray and provides complete autonomy without an Internet connection.

```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Build `stt.exe`
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole main.py -n stt.exe
```

`stt.exe` will be built in the `dist/` directory, where the files are already located models, notification sounds and the `whisper.cpp` binary.

Then the `dist/` directory can be copied to any convenient location on the computer and a shortcut to `cpp.exe` can be created in the startup folder to run with Windows startup.
